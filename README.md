About the Project 

This project is a website developed as part of the Systems Development curriculum at OrçaFacil. Its main goal is to solve a common problem faced by many small business owners, freelancers, and service providers: the difficulty of creating quick, professional, and organized quotes. Often, these individuals resort to manual methods (paper, WhatsApp messages) or struggle with accurate calculations, which can lead to lost sales and a less professional image. 

OrçaFácil aims to provide a simple, efficient, and user-friendly solution. Users can easily input client details and add products or services, with the system automatically calculating the total and generating a visually appealing quote ready for printing or sending to the client. The design focuses on a modern and user-friendly interface, ensuring accessibility and a seamless user experience across various devices. 

Target Audience: The system is designed for self-employed individuals, MEIs (Individual Micro-entrepreneurs), small shop owners, students organizing fairs or bazaars, and anyone who needs to create beautiful and fast quotes. 

Features 

Client Data Input: Easily fill in client details such as name, phone, and email. 

Dynamic Item Management: Add and remove products/services to the quote, specifying quantity and unit price. 

Automatic Total Calculation: The system automatically calculates the total value of the quote as items are added. 

Professional Quote Generation: Generate a visually appealing quote ready for presentation. 

PDF Export & Print Option: Option to print or save the generated quote as a PDF document. 

Responsive Design: Fully responsive design, adapting to different screen sizes (desktops, tablets, and smartphones). 

User Account Creation: Users can create an account to manage their quotes. 

Budget Management: View and manage a list of created budgets, including their status (approved/pending).
